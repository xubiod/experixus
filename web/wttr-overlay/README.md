<h4>A part of xubiod's <i>experixus - web division.</i></h4>

This experiment uses [wttr.in by chubin](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) and sites that provide random images for placeholders to make backgrounds with weather overlays.

At this state it can only use your location, but that might change in the future.
